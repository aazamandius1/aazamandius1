A human being should be able to ... design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, ... comfort the dying, take orders,
give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
analyze a new problem ..., PROGRAM A COMPUTER,
cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently,
die gallantly.
Specialization is for insects.
